pvr.demo.extras
===============
Dummy data and files to be used with the PVR Demo Add-on. This is aimed at XBMC skin developers.

This package was originally put together by Jezz_X. I just updated paths to keep it working in XBMC 13 and added the following:

- dummy recordings
- replaced the first tv channel (stream not working anymore)
- added more of the available genre colors in the epg
- added genre colors doc file

### Usage
You need to already have the demo addon installed for your OS and then extract this file and copy it over into the pvr demo addons install dir 1 file will need to be over-ridden namely PVRDemoAddonSettings.xml which holds all the information it needs. then go into settings\livetv\general and select "Reset the PVR database" to get the new info
